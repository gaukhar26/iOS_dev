# Swift Assignment #2 â€” Submission (by Gaukhar Zhanel)

This folder includes **10 separate `.swift` files**, one per problem, plus `AllProblems_Combined.swift` (all-in-one for quick view).  
Each file compiles and runs independently. Minimal, clear comments. Matches assignment requirements.

## How to run
- Interpreter mode: `swift Problem1_FizzBuzz.swift`
- Compile: `swiftc Problem1_FizzBuzz.swift -o p1 && ./p1`

Repeat for files 2..10.
